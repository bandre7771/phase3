1) [5pts] Registration: Registration: a new user has to provide the appropriate information; he/she can pick a login-name and a password. The login name should be checked for uniqueness.Ben - in progress2) [5pts] Reserve: After registration, a user can record a reservation to any TH (the same user may reserve the same TH multiple times from different available dates). Each user session (meaning each time after a user has logged into the system) may add one or more reservations, and all reservations added by a user in a user session are reported to him/her for the final review and confirmation, before they are added into the database.John - X3) [5pts] New TH: A user may record the details of a new TH, and may update the information regarding an existing TH he/she owns.John - in progress4) [5pts] Stays: A user can record a stay at any TH (the same user may stay at the same TH multiple times). Each user session (meaning each time after a user has logged into the system) may add one or more stays, and all stays added by a user in a user session are reported to him/her for the final review and confirmation, before they are added into the database. Note that a user may only record a stay at a TH during a period he/she has a reservation.Ben - in progress5) [5pts] Favorite recordings: Users can declare a TH as his/her favorite place to stay.

6) [5pts] Feedback recordings: Users can record their feedback for a TH. We should record the date, the numerical score (0= terrible, 10= excellent), and an optional short text. No changes are allowed; only one feedback per user per TH is allowed.John - X7) [5pts] Usefulness ratings: Users can assess a feedback record, giving it a numerical score 0, 1, or 2 (’useless’, ’useful’, ’very useful’ respectively). A user should not be allowed to provide a usefulness-rating for his/her own feedbacks.	John - X8) [5pts] Trust recordings: A user may declare zero or more other users as ‘trusted’ or ‘not-trusted’.John & Ben9) [20pts] TH Browsing: Users may search for THs, by asking conjunctive queries on the price (a range), and/or address (at CITY or State level), and/or name by keywords, and/or category. Your system should allow the user to specify that the results are to be sorted (a) by price, or (b) by the average numerical score of the feedbacks, or (c) by the average numerical score of the trusted user feedbacks.John - X10) [5pts] Useful feedbacks: For a given TH, a user could ask for the top n most ‘useful’ feedbacks. The value of n is user-specified (say, 5, or 10). The ‘usefulness’ of a feedback is its average ‘usefulness’ score.John & Ben11) [10pts] TH suggestions: Like most e-commerce websites, when a user records his/her reservations to a TH ‘A’, your system should give a list of other suggested THs. TH ‘B’ is suggested, if there exist a user ‘X’ that visited both ‘A’ and ‘B’. The suggested THs should be sorted on decreasing total visit count (i.e., most popular first); count only visits by users like ‘X’.John & Ben12) [10pts] ‘Two degrees of separation’: Given two user names (logins), determine their ‘degree of separation’, defined as follows: Two users ‘A’ and ‘B’ are 1-degree away if they have both favorited at least one common TH; they are 2-degrees away if there exists an user ‘C’ who is 1-degree away from each of ‘A’ and ‘B’, AND ‘A’ and ‘B’ are not 1-degree away at the same time.John & Ben - X13) [10pts] Statistics: At any point, a user may want to show• the list of the m (say m = 5) most popular THs (in terms of total visits) for each category,• the list of m most expensive THs (defined by the average cost per person of all visits to a TH) for each category• the list of m highly rated THs (defined by the average scores from all feedbacks a TH has received) for each categoryJohn - X14) [5pts] User awards: At random points of time, the admin user wants to give awards to the ‘best’ users; thus, the admin user needs to know:• the top m most ‘trusted’ users (the trust score of a user is the count of users ‘trusting’ him/her, minus the count of users ‘not-trusting’ him/her)• the top m most ‘useful’ users (the usefulness score of a user is the average ‘usefulness’ of all of his/her feedbacks combined)
